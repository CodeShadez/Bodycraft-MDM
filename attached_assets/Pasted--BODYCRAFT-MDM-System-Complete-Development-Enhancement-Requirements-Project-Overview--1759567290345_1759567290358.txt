## Priority 3: Approval Workflow System

### Asset Request Workflow
**Process Flow**:
1. Location user submits new asset request
2. System sends notification to administrator
3. Administrator reviews request details
4. Administrator approves or rejects with comments
5. Database updates with decision and timestamp
6. User receives notification of decision
7. If approved, asset gets assigned to location

### Issue Reporting Workflow
**Process Flow**:
1. Location user reports asset problem/malfunction
2. System logs issue with timestamp and details
3. Administrator receives immediate notification
4. Administrator investigates and updates status
5. Administrator approves repair/replacement action
6. Asset status automatically updates in database
7. User receives status update notification

### Workflow Requirements
**Technical Implementation**:
- Create approval queue dashboard for administrators
- Implement notification system (email and in-app)
- Add status tracking for all requests
- Maintain complete audit trail and history logs
- Add escalation procedures for urgent requests
