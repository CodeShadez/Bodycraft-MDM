Phase 2: Build Advanced Enterprise Features
Proceed only after Phase 1 is fully functional and tested.

Predictive Analytics Dashboard
a. Endpoint GET /api/analytics/predictive-maintenance

Gather assigned assets with maintenance history: purchase_date, maintenance_count, avg_maintenance_cost, last_maintenance_date, days_since_maintenance.

Apply risk model: assign failure_risk (‘low’/‘medium’/‘high’), predicted_days_to_failure, recommended_action, estimated_cost.

Return array of predictions.
b. UI Component

Display table or cards for each asset: ID, model, risk, days_to_failure, action, cost.

Allow filters by location, asset type, and risk level.

Enable drill-down to full maintenance history.

Asset Utilization Optimization
a. Endpoint GET /api/analytics/utilization-optimization

Compute per-location: total_assets, assigned_assets, available_assets, total_employees, utilization_rate.

Calculate assets_per_employee, efficiency_score, and generate AI-driven recommendations with priority levels.
b. UI Component

Render heatmap of utilization_rate across locations.

List top recommendations per location with priority and expected gains.

Provide export option (CSV/Excel) for recommendations.

Multi-Location Management
a. Endpoint GET /api/locations/performance-analytics

For each outlet: total_assets, active_assets, total_employees, active_employees, total_maintenance, total_maintenance_cost, total_compliance_tasks, completed_compliance, avg_compliance_score.

Compute metrics: utilization_rate, compliance_rate, asset_per_employee, avg_maintenance_cost, performance_score.

Sort and rank locations by score; include performance_rank.
b. Endpoint POST /api/locations/transfer-asset

Validate asset exists and is not assigned.

If Location User transferring cross-location, create approval request; return pending status.

If Admin or same-location transfer, update asset.location_id, insert into asset_transfers and audit_logs.
c. UI Components

Location performance dashboard showing sortable table and charts.

Transfer workflow: select asset, from/to locations, reason; show approval status or immediate transfer result.

Real-Time Business Intelligence Dashboard
a. Endpoint GET /api/dashboard/real-time-data

Aggregate in one response: asset stats (total, assigned, available, maintenance, retired), financials (total_invoices, paid, pending, count), maintenance stats (total, completed, scheduled, overdue, avg_cost), compliance stats (total, completed, overdue, avg_score), recent_activities (last 10 events with type, entity, date).

Compute rates: utilization_rate, collection_rate, maintenance_completion_rate, compliance_completion_rate.

Include last_updated timestamp.
b. Endpoint GET /api/dashboard/trends

Accept metric (‘assets’, ‘maintenance’, ‘compliance’) and period (‘daily’, ‘weekly’, ‘monthly’).

Return time-series data grouped by period with counts and relevant aggregates (e.g., cost, avg_score).
c. UI Component

Auto-refresh every 30 seconds.

Interactive charts: bar/line charts for trends; pie charts for status distributions.

Filter controls for period, location, and metric.

Alerts banner when key rates drop below thresholds.

General Best Practices
Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

Enforce role-based access in every route.

Log all create/update/delete actions in audit trails.

Add indexes and materialized views for analytics.

Implement Redis caching for dashboard endpoints.

Monitor API response times; log warnings if >1 second.

Write unit and integration tests for each endpoint.

Validate all user inputs on both frontend and backend.

Provide clear error messages and use proper HTTP status codes.

Proceed methodically: complete each task, test thoroughly, then move to the next. Provide progress updates after finishing each numbered item. Good luck!”
