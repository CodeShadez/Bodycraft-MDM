# The Complete BODYCRAFT Master Data Management (MDM) System: Comprehensive Human-Readable Prompt

## Project Overview and Context

I need you to build a complete Master Data Management (MDM) system for BODYCRAFT, a company with 32 outlets across India. This is a mission-critical system that will replace their current manual Excel-based asset tracking with a modern, automated, and integrated digital platform.

**Current Situation:**
BODYCRAFT currently manages IT assets manually using Excel spreadsheets across all their outlets. This creates major problems: when an employee like Rajesh gets a laptop and later returns it, and the same laptop is assigned to Priya, they lose all of Rajesh's assignment history. They have no way to track who had what equipment, when they had it, what condition it was in, or any backup details. This manual process is error-prone, time-consuming, and provides no audit trail.

**The Vision:**
Create a centralized web-based system where any IT administrator can instantly find any asset, see its complete assignment history, assign it to employees, track maintenance, and integrate with existing CCTV and biometric systems - all while preserving every piece of historical data forever.

## Core Business Requirements

### 1. Complete Asset Management
**What I need:** A comprehensive system to manage all types of IT assets including:
- Laptops (Dell, HP, Lenovo, Apple)
- Desktop computers with components (monitors, CPUs, keyboards, mice)

- Networking equipment (routers, switches, access points, DVRs)
- Communication devices (landline phones, billing printers)
- Specialized equipment (security systems, UPS units, cables)

**Key Features Required:**
- Custom asset IDs following BODYCRAFT convention (BFC001, BFC002, etc.)
- Complete asset specifications (model, brand, service tag, purchase date, warranty)
- Real-time status tracking (Available, Assigned, Maintenance, Retired)

- Advanced search across all fields simultaneously
- Bulk import from existing Excel files
- Export capabilities for reports and audits

### 2. Employee and Assignment Management
**What I need:** Complete employee database with sophisticated assignment tracking that NEVER overwrites historical data.

**Critical Assignment Logic:**
- When Rajesh (employee code BFC2024001) gets laptop BFC001, create assignment record
- When Rajesh returns laptop (3 weeks later), update return date and condition but KEEP the assignment record
- When Priya (employee code BFC2024002) gets the same laptop, create NEW assignment record
