# BODYCRAFT Master Data Management (MDM) System: Complete Design Specification

## Executive Summary

The BODYCRAFT Master Data Management (MDM) system is a comprehensive, enterprise-level web application designed to revolutionize how BODYCRAFT manages IT assets across their 32 outlets throughout India. This system transforms their current manual, Excel-based asset tracking into a modern, automated, and integrated digital platform that ensures complete accountability, historical preservation, and operational efficiency.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure
BODYCRAFT currently operates with:
- **32 outlets** across India with diverse IT infrastructure needs
- **Manual Excel-based tracking** with inconsistent data entry and no version control
- **Fragmented systems** with separate management for CCTV, biometric, and asset data
- **No historical tracking** resulting in lost information when assets are reassigned
- **Multiple asset types** including laptops, desktops, monitors, mobile devices, networking equipment, and specialized devices

Based on the JP Nagar location audit data, the typical outlet manages:
- Desktop computers and components (monitors, CPUs, keyboards, mice)
- Mobile devices (laptops, tablets, smartphones)
- Networking equipment (routers, switches, DVRs)
- Communication devices (landline phones, billing printers)
- Specialized equipment (security systems, access points)

## System Architecture and Design Philosophy

### Core Design Principles

**1. Data Integrity First**
